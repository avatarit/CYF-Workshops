let total = console.log(10,32);

console.log(total);

// Without running the code, predict and explain what total will evaluate to

// total will evaluate to undefined. The console.log function does not return a value; 
// it simply outputs the values to the console. Therefore, when you assign the result of console.log(10, 32) 
// to the variable total, total will be undefined because console.log does not return anything.
