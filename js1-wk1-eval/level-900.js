// Create a variable called ageGap and assign to it the difference between grandFatherAge and mitchAge
// Log the value of ageGap to the console 
let ageGap = grandFatherAge - mitchAge;
console.log(ageGap); // Output: 50
// The ageGap variable calculates the difference between grandFatherAge (83) and mitchAge (33), resulting in 50.
// This value is then logged to the console, showing the age gap between Mitch and his grandfather.
